Binary Search - It is a searching algorithm with a limited search space
it is sorted as well
example: consider a word "help"
so we will find the word help in each and every page of dictionary until it is found
another way splitting the dictionary pages and checking based on alphabet either in left side or right side
Basic Code:
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
target  = int(input())
n= len(arr)
low = 0
high = n-1
while low<=high:
    mid = (low+high)//2
    if arr[mid]==target:
        print(mid)
    elif target>arr[mid]:
        low = mid+1
    else:
        high = mid-1
print(-1)

Recursive Binary search:
def binarysearch(arr,low,high,target):
    if low>high:
        return -1
    mid = (low+high)//2
    if arr[mid]==target:
        return mid
    elif target>arr[mid]:
        return binarysearch(arr,mid+1,high,target)
    else:
        return binarysearch(arr,low,mid-1,target)
        
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
target  = int(input())
n= len(arr)
low = 0
high = n-1
print(binarysearch(arr,low,high,target))
