What is Doubly Linked List?
A process in which the traversal can happen in both the directions.

1.Create a Array to doubly LinkedList.
2. Delete head Node in doubly LinkedList

1. Create a Array to doubly LinkedList:
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self,val):
        self.val = val
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None
def DLL(arr):
    if not arr:
        return
    head = ListNode(arr[0])
    prev = head
    for i in range(1,len(arr)):
        temp = ListNode(arr[i])
        prev.next = temp
        prev=temp
    curr = head
    while curr:
        print(curr.val,end=" ")
        if curr.next:
            print("<->",end=" ")
        curr = curr.next
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
DLL(arr)

2. Delete head Node in doubly LinkedList
