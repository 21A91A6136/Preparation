why Linked List?
* In array we cannot add numbers once the array size is fixed. 
* It can increase its size at any time.
* It is not stored in contiguous location. 
* data is linked with next 
* locate 1st element as head
Where it is used?
It is used in stack and Queue because they have flexible size.
Real Life example: rendering to different pages from the actual page.

1. Length of a linked list
2. Search element in Linked List

1. Length of a linked list
class Solution:
    def getCount(self, head):
        c=0
        temp = head
        while(temp):
            temp = temp.next
            c+=1
        return c
2. Search element in Linked List
class Solution:
    def searchKey(self, n, head, key):
        #Code here
        temp = head
        while(temp):
            if temp.data==key:
                return True
            temp = temp.next
        return False
